                    üëã Howdy! My name is Lanz Alexander I. Malto. I am 21 years old, and the only child in the family.
                    I'm a Filipino, originally from NCR, but I am currently situated at Negros Oriental. I am an 
                    undergraduate of the course Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, and I am an aspiring 
                    Software Developer.

            <h1>My Personality </h1>
            <p>
                üó® As an ambivert, I enjoy interacting with others just as much as I enjoy my me time (<i>although,
                I am biased towards the latter</i> ). As an almost-always bored person who anticipates the next
                adventure, I'm usually one of the first people to accept any invitation to go places, either with
                my loyal 14-man friend group, or with my tightly-knit group of cousins.
                
                <br><br>

                üôå I am also a thrill-seeker, although more on the academic side of things. I pride myself in being 
                active, both with my college's student body, and in the co- and extra-curricular aspects of my 
                school life. In this regard, school has helped me awaken my leadership potential and developed my
                skills. Professionally, I am a detail-oriented and adaptable individual who learns quickly and 
                knows how to follow instructions. If you'll ask me, I prefer working on my own. However, I can 
                still make ends meet with others as best as I can.

        <h1>Professional Experience</h1>
        <p>
            I have had my fair share of achievements and professional experience that I'm very much happy
            to share about. Yet, there are some which I'm notably proud of. These are, namely:

                <dt>üèÖ First Runner-Up: DICT-7 Regional AI.deas Pitching Competition - Social Development 
                    Solutions (06/2024)</dt>
                <dd>
                    This is the second hackathon that I joined. My role here was the group's pitcher.
                    In summary, our group's solution was a Weather Informatics App with AI-supported
                    remote-controlled/auto-irrigation system. I focused on the business-side of things 
                    on my group's solution, and touched on the AI capabilities (upon scaling) of our 
                    prototype.

                <dt>üèÖ First Runner-Up: PSITE Central Visayas Regional Hackathon (03/2024)</dt>
                <dd>
                    As the first hackathon I ever joined in my entire life, I was admittedly nervous going
                    into this activity. I can also recall needing to brainstorm page and logic flows and
                    preparing code with my teammates the night before the competition, so the pressure was
                    on. Since we were all first-timers in the group, we all went all around and basically
                    shared the hackathon roles we were told to (<i>preferably</i>) split amongst ourselves.

                <dt>üíº College Auditor: Silliman Univeristy College of Computer Studies (2023-2024)</dt>
                <dd>
                    Going into my sophomore years, I was tapped to be the College Auditor by a good friend
                    of mine (<i>who was the Public Relations Officer at the time</i>). During which, 
                    I was already an Executive Committee Head, and I was open to and entertained talks of 
                    me running for office. The experience was admittedly quite taxing, yet I'm happy I was
                    still able to fulfill my role as auditor of the College. Notable contributions included
                    the decrease of Council Fees, the creation of a proper accounting system within the College,
                    and full organization on Financial and Expense Reports of the College.

                <dt>üñ•Ô∏è Programmer: SU Team ka-SEA-kas, AppCon Dev 2023 Participant (12/2023-02/2024)</dt>
                <dd>
                    Before our university's application to join the national AppCon Dev 2023 competition 
                    by OTis Philippines Inc., I was connected to a senior in our College. This senior 
                    linked me up with his team to join the contest. After I also talked with trusted
                    batchmates, my senior set us up to learn some Laravel for the competition. We were tasked
                    to accomplish sprints with the group, and it was overall a fun learning experience. This 
                    is especially since we weren't about to take the Application Development course yet 
                    until later years.

                <dt>üèÖ Dean's List/Highest CQPA: Silliman Univeristy College of Computer Studies (2022-2024)</dt>
                <dd>
                    Perhaps a personal testimony to the efforts I have exerted during my time in
                    the College, I was blessed to garner the Dean's List Award for 2 consecutive years,
                    and the Highest CQPA award for the Academic Year 2022-2023.

                <dt>üèÖ 2nd Place: Silliman Univeristy SU Math Blitz Quiz Bee (03/2024)<dt>
                <dd>
                    Actually, this Quiz Bee my friends and I participated in was a last-minute decision.
                    In the competition, our group was filled with jokes and laughter in between solving,
                    and the facilitators actually crowded around and occasionally laughed with us as
                    they watched us discuss and fool around. We clinched from 4th place up to 2nd place 
                    in the last 'Do or Die' round of the Quiz Bee, and secured the win.

                    There are a lot of things in life which I enjoy spending time on. Some of these
                    I can only sometimes enjoy, all make me happy nonetheless.
                    These are my interests which I point those sentiments toward:

                Of course, as human, we're one and the same in having our own sets of weaknesses,
                whether we'd like to admit it or not. Here are the things which I believe I ought
